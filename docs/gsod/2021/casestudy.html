<h3>About Performance Co-Pilot</h3>
<p>
Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open-source distributed
system performance analysis toolkit.
It efficiently collects metrics from multiple systems and
provides a variety of web, graphical and console tools for
analysis of live and historical data.
</p>
<p>
The suite begun production use over 20 years ago primarily
in the High Performance Computing arena, however its
customizable and lightweight design has proven popular on
everything from tiny system-on-a-chip machines through to
vast databases and number-crunching super computers.
It is included in all Linux distributions and has an active
base of users and developers.

<h3>About Task-based Guides</h3>
</div>
<div class='row'>
<p>
In our
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2020/proposal.html'>previous</a>
Google Season of Docs project, we converted
two freely-available books (the "Users and Administrators Guide"
and the "Programmers Guide"), the REST API documentation, and
other content into
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>pcp.readthedocs.io</a>
content.
</p>
<p>
It is this
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2021/proposal.html'>latest</a>
project we tackled the curation of a new, consistent series of
focussed, task-oriented "How To" guides that assist new users
in engaging immediately, by clearly showing how to solve small
specific problem scenarios users encounter frequently.
</p>
</div>

<h3>Proposal Abstract</h3>
</div>
<div class='row'>
<p>
The primary goal of this
<a href='https://pcp.io/gsod/2021/proposal.html'>project</a>
was to assist first-time users to become more productive right away,
while also directing traffic toward the more detailed books in the
<a href='https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'>same</a>
location.

<p>
Three experiences community members volunteered to assist -
PCP maintainers, developer and a documentation specialist.
</p>
<p>
Our writer from last year agreed to work with us once more.
</p>
<p>
With contributors spanning only APAC countries (Australia,
Japan and India, we found we were able to communicate well
once more, with quick responses being in similar timezones.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Creating the proposal</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
Initial work on proposal creation was done by Nathan in
collaboration with Arzoo, based on guides we had in the
form of email exchanges, as well as pre-existing guides
in different formats from the original website.
</p>
<p>
Once all involved agreed on the initial project content
we moved into establishing the project budget plan.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Budget</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
We primarily based our initial budget on funding our
writer, based on previous years activities and the
recommended reasonable ranges of funding from Google.
</p>
<p>
One unexpected area of difficulty was interacting with
financing and shipping companies in India.
After a relatively trouble-free initial payment to our
writer early on, the environment around OpenCollective
seemed to change for payments in India and we continue
to work with them to ensure subsequent payments arrive.
</p>
<p>
Similarly, we budgeted also for some swag, but trouble
with shipments into India by our swag provider company
<a href='https://www.redbubble.com/i/hat/Performance-Co-Pilot-classic-logo-by-pcp-maintainers/89364453.FACOX'>Red Bubble</a>
meant some contributors ended up donating their funding
to the PCP project for other uses, for now, with a plan
for folks travelling for a in-person meetup to arrange
personal delivery of swag in the future when possible.
</p>
<p>
Other than these problems, the budget overall was quite
appropriate and worked out well.
</p>
</div>
<h4>Timeline</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
Arzoo maintained an excellent
<a href='https://github.com/arzoo14/Google-Season-of-Docs-2021/blob/main/timeline_deliverables.md'>timeline of deliverable items</a>
and the status of each item, throughout the project.
</p>
<p>
There were a couple of disruptions during the length
of the project - laptop hardware failure and a short
period of recuperation after illness - but Arzoo was
able to recover from these setbacks to complete most
of the planned work (mainly we didn't get into extra
items and stretch goals like short video tutorials).
</p>
</div>
<h4>Results</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
TODO
</p>
</div>
<h4>Measuring Success</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
We anticipated the new guides would provide a better
suited entry point for new and inexperienced users.
</p>
<p>
Arzoo enabled
<a href='https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/google-analytics.html'>Google analytics</a>
early on in the project.
Since these were very few guides to start with, and a
disrupted section in the middle of the project, this is
a summary of our observed traffic statistics at the end:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>46% of views (out of 1040) involved the Quick Guides</li>
<li>37% of users (out of 244) opened the Quick Guides</li>
<li>6% (out of 223) were new users</li>
</ul>
</p>
</div>
<h4>Analysis</h4>
<div class='col__module--doc'>
<p>
TODO.
What went well? What was unexpected? What hurdles or setbacks did you face? Do you consider your project successful? Why or why not? (If it's too early to tell, explain when you expect to be able to judge the success of your project.)
What metrics did you choose to measure the success of the project? Were you able to collect those metrics? Did the metrics correlate well or poorly with the outcomes you wanted for the project? Did your metrics change since your proposal?

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
An excellent result for the Performance Co-Pilot project.
</p>
<p>
We have a great set of short guides getting new users of
the software able to solve problems immediately, and to
learn more quickly about the wider set of PCP tools.
</p>
<p>
We introduced consistency into all Tutorials and Guides
across the project, by using a single readthedocs.io
landing page for all PCP guides (same location, format,
look-and-feel).
Each new guide we add now will be incorporated into the
set we've established during this project.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what we'd do differently next time, perhaps
a focus on getting video tutorials and animated console
examples integrated earlier on would have helped us to
get content suited to that medium using it more instead
of running out of time to explore that at the end.
</p>
<p>
We've really enjoyed working with Arzoo further improving
the PCP documentation - a big thanks again to Google for
running this program!
