            %h3 About Performance Co-Pilot
            %p
              Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) is an open-source distributed
              system performance analysis toolkit.
              It efficiently collects metrics from multiple systems and
              provides a variety of web, graphical and console tools for
              analysis of live and historical data.
            %p
              The suite begun production use over 20 years ago primarily
              in the High Performance Computing arena, however its
              customizable and lightweight design has proven popular on
              everything from tiny system-on-a-chip machines through to
              vast databases and number-crunching super computers.
              It is included in all Linux distributions and has an active
              base of users and developers.

          %h3 About Task-based Guides
        %div{:class => 'row'}
          %p
            In our previous Google Season of Docs project, we converted
            two freely-available books (the "Users and Administrators Guide"
            and the "Programmers Guide") into
            %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'} pcp.readthedocs.io
            content.
            We also extended this documentation with a new REST API guide,
            and made many other improvements.
          %p
            However, due to the many available tools, daemons, integrations
            and APIs we still find a high barrier to entry for new PCP
            users.
          %p
            It is this we plan to tackle next with our writer - curating a
            new series of focussed, task-oriented "How To" guides that will
            assist new users in engaging immediately, by clearly showing
            how to solve specific problem scenarios that users encounter
            frequently.
          %p
            The goals of the project are this to assist first-time users to
            become more productive right away, while also increasing traffic
            to the more detailed books in the same location (readthedocs.io).
            We plan to undertake this project over three months.
          %br

          %h4 The Task-based Guides project will:
          %p
            Pair developers with the writer to produce succinct step-by-step
            recipes showing how to perform certain tasks with PCP.
          %p
            Task-based topics include:

            Additionally, the writer will:

            %li
              Canvas the community for additional topics beyond the
              set above to produce an initial set of high-value guides
            %li
              Provide feedback to developers about potential areas of
              improvements in the tools to create more satisfying early
              user experiences.
            %li
              Audit existing documentation for tutorial content to add
              into the new
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/'} readthedocs
              guide format.
              This involves an assessment of the existing
              %a{:href => 'https://pcp.io/documentation.html'} Short Guides
              and refactoring these into the
              %strong "How do I..."
              form.
            %li
              Introduce consistency into all Tutorials and Guides
              across the project, by using a single readthedocs.io
              landing page for all guides (same location, format,
              look-and-feel).

          %p
            This project will focus on core PCP functionality,
            and not on integration with (for example) 3rd party
            sources of metrics, or sending PCP metrics to other
            analysis systems.

                  We have a strong technical writing candidate for the
                  project who was our writer from Google Season of Docs
                  last year and is interested in working on another major
                  project.
                  We have a proven, successful relationship that we are
                  keen to continue to build on.
                %p
                  This project expands on the readthedocs documentation that
                  was produced last year, so we anticipate rapid results as
                  our writer is already very familiar with PCP and Grafana.

                  Three volunteers have come forward to assist Arzoo again - a
                  PCP maintainer, a developer and a documentation specialist -
                  all of whom volunteered last year as well.

            %h3 Measuring Success
            %p
              We anticipate the How To pages will provide a better suited
              entry point for both new and some existing users.
              We will measure this by first enabling
              %a{:href => 'https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guides/google-analytics.html'} Google analytics
              on our readthedocs pages to begin tracking page accesses.
            %p
              %strong Success will be indicated by:
            %ul
              %li
                The largest number of hits to documentation pages being to the
                new Task-based Guides pages (we expect greater than double any
                other books as a measure of success).
                This success measure will be presented as a graph showing the
                spread of hits, with the most being attributed to the new
                Task-based Guides.
              %li
                A correlated increase in the number of hits to the existing
                PCP documentation - the
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/UAG/AboutUserAdministratorsGuide.html'} Users Guide ,
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/PG/AboutProgrammersGuide.html'} Programmers Guide
                and
                %a{:href => 'https://pcp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/'} REST API Guide
                as a result of the new (shorter, focussed) guides.
                We aim for a 20% increase in access to the other Guides as our
                success measure.
              %li
                Some guides will be in different forms - video-based vs text -
                we'll also use the analytics to determine which formats are
                more successful than others.
                This will be presented as a graph also; simply having this
                breakdown will indicate success to us, we can use that
                information to decide future documentation styles to prefer.

              PCP is a mature open source project, active now for
              well over 20 years.
              We have experience mentoring students and writers,
              participating in Google Summer of Code for 5 years,
              and in last years Google Season of Docs program.
              We had a very successfully collaboration with our
              writer last year which we'd love to build on further
              this year.
            %p
              Thank you for running the Season of Docs program.
              Our users have benefitted immensely from it and it
              has allowed us to move in directions our resources
              would not have allowed so we're extremely grateful!
